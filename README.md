# 🏠 House Price Prediction ML Project

## 📌 Overview
This project builds a full machine learning pipeline to predict housing prices using real-world housing data.  
The goal is to compare multiple regression models and analyze bias–variance tradeoffs.

## 🔧 Features
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model comparison (Ridge, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluation with RMSE & R² & MSA
- Final prediction interface

## 📊 Dataset
California Housing dataset (~20k samples)

## 🧠 Models Used
- Ridge Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## 📈 Results
XGBoost achieved the best validation performance and generalization on test data.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib
